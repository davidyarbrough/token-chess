# AI Operation Logs

## 2025-02-09 22:07:37 CST
- Created initial ADR documenting architectural decisions
- Established docs/adrs directory for architectural decision records
- Created this AI operations log file

## 2025-02-09 22:16:45 CST
- Created comprehensive Jest test suite
- Added test configuration to package.json
- Created mock files for Jest
- Implemented tests for:
  - Token management
  - Board management
  - Piece movement
  - Game state
  - Layout and responsiveness
- Noted untestable aspects:
  - Phaser-specific rendering
  - Real-time user interactions
  - Touch events
  - Animation sequences

## 2025-02-09 22:19:06 CST
- Reorganized test resources into a top-level `tests` directory
- Created new directory structure:
  - `tests/mocks/` for mock files
  - `tests/unit/scenes/` for scene tests
- Updated Jest configuration in package.json to reflect new structure
- Removed old `__mocks__` and `__tests__` directories

## 2025-02-12 18:09:28 CST
- Refactored token system:
  - Created new constants file for token pools and mappings
  - Implemented dynamic token requirements based on available tokens
  - Moved token pools to configuration
- Fixed bugs:
  - Fixed token selection error caused by incorrect Phaser type checking
  - Fixed issue with pawns incorrectly requiring neutral token selection
  - Improved token highlighting logic
- Problem Resolution:
  - Initial attempt to use `instanceof Phaser.GameObjects.Circle` failed
  - Fixed by checking object type property directly: `child.type === 'Circle'`

## 2025-02-12 19:45:40 CST
- Refactored GameScene for better encapsulation and maintainability:
  - Split large methods into smaller, focused functions
  - Removed commented out code and unused methods
  - Improved state management with dedicated handlers
  - Organized code by responsibility:
    - Token management
    - Piece movement
    - Game state handling
    - UI updates
  - Removed duplicate code in handlePieceClick and handleTileClick
  - Improved method names to better reflect their purpose

## 2025-02-12 19:50:20 CST
- Fixed bug with token selection state:
  - Game was transitioning to neutral token selection even when no token was used
  - Added check to ensure both:
    1. The piece requires a token
    2. A token was actually selected and used
  - Now correctly proceeds to next turn if no token was used

## 2025-02-12 19:54:10 CST
- Fixed turn switching logic:
  - For pieces requiring tokens:
    - Keep same player's turn during token selection
    - Switch to next player after neutral token swap
  - For pieces not requiring tokens:
    - Switch to next player immediately after move
  - Implemented by updating chess.js FEN string to change active player

## 2025-02-12 20:16:20 CST
- Refactored initialization logic into separate GameInitializer class:
  - Moved layout creation, token pool setup, and game state initialization
  - Created dedicated methods for each initialization task:
    - initializeGame: Sets up game state and token pools
    - createLayout: Handles board creation and dimensions
    - createTokenPools: Manages token UI elements
    - createTurnIndicator: Sets up turn display
  - GameScene now delegates all initialization to GameInitializer
  - Improved code organization and separation of concerns

## Previous Operations (Summarized)
- Implemented responsive game board with Phaser 3
- Added token pools with specific positioning requirements
- Fixed piece duplication bug during moves
- Restored original piece colors after inadvertent change
- Implemented chess.js for game logic
- Added piece movement and selection mechanics
