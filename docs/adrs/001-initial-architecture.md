# 1. Initial Architecture Decisions for Token Chess

Date: 2025-02-09

Accepted

## Context

Token Chess is a unique variant of chess where players must spend tokens to move certain pieces. The game needs to be accessible on both web and mobile platforms, maintain standard chess rules while implementing the token system, and provide a smooth user experience across different screen sizes.

## Decisions

### 1. Game Engine Selection
- **Decision**: Use Phaser 3 as the primary game engine
- **Rationale**: 
  - Provides robust 2D game development capabilities
  - Excellent cross-platform support
  - Built-in scaling and responsive design features
  - Strong community support and documentation
  - WebGL rendering with Canvas fallback

### 2. Chess Logic Implementation
- **Decision**: Use chess.js library for core chess rules
- **Rationale**:
  - Industry-standard chess logic implementation
  - Handles all standard chess rules (moves, check, checkmate)
  - Well-maintained and battle-tested
  - Easy integration with custom game logic

### 3. UI/UX Design
- **Decision**: Implement responsive design with dynamic layout
- **Details**:
  - Board scales based on screen size
  - Token pools positioned strategically:
    - Black tokens: Horizontal pool above board
    - White tokens: Horizontal pool below board
    - Neutral tokens: Vertical/horizontal pool on right side
  - Unicode symbols for chess pieces
  - Visual feedback for piece selection
  - Touch-friendly interface

### 4. State Management
- **Decision**: Use combination of chess.js and custom state management
- **Details**:
  - chess.js handles core chess state
  - Custom state for token system
  - Piece movement validation through chess.js
  - Token validation through custom logic

### 5. Build System
- **Decision**: Use Vite as build tool
- **Rationale**:
  - Fast development server with HMR
  - Efficient production builds
  - Built-in TypeScript support
  - Simple configuration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Implement Jest for testing game logic
- Test coverage for:
  - Token management
  - Move validation
  - Game state transitions
  - UI component behavior

### Integration Testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Test scenarios:
  - Complete game flows
  - Token spending mechanics
  - Board state synchronization
  - Responsive design behavior

### Manual Testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile device testing
- Touch interaction testing
- Performance testing

## Deployment Strategy

### Web Deployment
1. **Development**:
   - Local development server using Vite
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

2. **Staging**:
   - not required at this stage, will be addressed as needed.

3. **Production**:
   - Deploy to Netlify/Vercel
   - Automated deployment on main branch updates
   - CDN integration for asset delivery

### Mobile Deployment
1. **PWA Implementation**:
   - Service worker for offline support
   - Web app manifest
   - Installable on mobile devices

2. **Native Wrapper (Future)**:
   - Capacitor/Cordova integration
   - App Store deployment
   - Play Store deployment

## Performance Targets
- Initial load time < 3s
- 60 FPS gameplay
- Responsive to input within 100ms
- PWA lighthouse score > 90

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development with modern tools
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Efficient state management
- Scalable architecture

### Negative
- Additional complexity from token system
- Need to manage multiple state sources
- Mobile performance optimization required

### Risks
- Token system integration complexity
- Mobile touch interaction challenges
- Cross-browser compatibility issues

## Future Considerations
1. Multiplayer support
2. AI opponent implementation
3. User accounts and persistence
4. Tournament/ranking system
5. Analytics integration
